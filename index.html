This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use data in relation to the use of our services.

1. Information We Collect

We only collect publicly available URLs of Instagram Reels that:

Are publicly accessible (not private or restricted);

Are still available on the internet at the time of collection.

No personal data, private content, or user-identifiable information is collected, stored, or processed.

2. Purpose of Collection

The collection of public Reel URLs is solely for [briefly state purpose â€“ e.g., research, analytics, content indexing, etc.]. These URLs are used only in the context of their public availability.

3. Data Usage

We do not share or sell any collected URLs.

We do not perform any profiling or tracking of individuals.

URLs are used strictly for [state purpose again briefly].

4. Data Retention

Collected URLs are stored only for as long as they remain valid and publicly accessible. URLs that are no longer active or publicly available are periodically removed.

5. User Rights

Since we do not collect personal data, standard data subject rights (access, deletion, correction, etc.) under data protection laws do not typically apply. However, if you believe a collected URL violates privacy rights, you may contact us for review.
